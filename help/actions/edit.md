# Editing

- To **edit** a the text of an item, [[select]] it and tap the _Enter_ key.
- When you finish editing, tap the _Enter_ key (again) to save your changes.

Several other kinds of editing are available. They are available in a circular palette, which I call the **editing tools**. Long click (hold down for half a second) on an item to bring it up (as illustrated above).

- Trash can: **delete** the item.
- Two plus buttons:
	- Right-pointing: add a **child**.
	- Left-pointing: select and add an additional **parent**.
- Upward-pointing: **change** selection to the same item, but **in its next parent**.
