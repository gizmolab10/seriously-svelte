# Focusing

- The left-most dot (anchoring the graph) is the **focus dot** and represents the **focused item**.
- The title of the **focused item** appears above the graph.
- You can click the **focus dot** to make it the **selected** item. This changes the **focus** to the parent (if there is one).
- If the **selected** item has children, tap the _Forward Slash /_ key (or long hold the mouse or touch on that dot) to **focus** on it.
- You can click one of the **breadcrumbs** (above the graph) to make it the **focused item** (unless it has no children).
