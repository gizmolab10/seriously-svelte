# Dots

![[dots.png]]

---
Each item in the graph has a **drag** dot on the left. In the tree graph, some items have a **reveal** dot on the right (both illustrated above).

- Click a reveal dot to **hide or reveal** the items in its list. This helps to remove distracting clutter so that you can then look at just what is relevant.
- Click on the drag dot to [[select]] an item. However, when you hold the mouse down for half a second, the item will become the [[focus]].
- **Hovering** over a dot will reverse its color. This tells you that something will happen when you click on it.

### What are those tiny dots?

- The tiny dots **around the reveal dot** represent the number of its children.
- The tiny dots **inside the drag dot** represent the number of its parents.
- The dot stuck to the **left side of the drag dot** indicates it has items related to it.
