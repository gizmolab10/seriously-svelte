# Breadcrumbs

![[breadcrumbs.png]]  

---
The idea of breadcrumbs came from Hansel and Gretel who left them behind, planning to follow them home. As your hierarchy grows, it can be easy to forget where you are at the moment (i.e., your [[focus]]). Breadcrumbs help you remember.

The [[focus]] is dark. The [[select|selected]] item is outlined. They do nothing when you click on them. Any of the other breadcrumbs can be clicked on, to make it the focus.

The breadcrumbs to the left of the focus are its ancestry, telling you where you are. Those to its right show the progeny path to the selected item.
