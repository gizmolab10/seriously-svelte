# Welcome to Seriously

Seriously is a [[graph]] of your hierarchical data. Think: hierarchical pop-down menu, but less fussy. [[browse|Browse]] around. Zoom your [[focus]] (hide unimportant stuff). [[edit|Edit]] your data in comfort and instantly see the impact.

It has four areas (illustrated below): [[details|Details]] are at the lower left. The large area at the lower right is the [[graph]]. There are two bands at the top: [[controls]] (above) and [[breadcrumbs]].
