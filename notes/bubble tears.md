âœ… Summary of Strategies Attempted to Solve Hydration Lateness in Bubble Plugin:

1. **Used `on page load` workflow**  
   â†’ Attempted to trigger hydration check and set a flag (`isHydrated`) early.

2. **Created helper group (`booleanHelper`)**  
   â†’ Used dynamic expressions (`5 is 5`, `current date/time > constant`) to produce a `yes/no` flag.

3. **Bound `readyToUpdate` exposed state to booleanHelperâ€™s output**  
   â†’ Verified with debugger that it eventually becomes `yes`.

4. **Blocked `update()` in plugin code**  
   â†’ Guard clause: `if (!instance.data.readyToUpdate) return`.

5. **Observed plugin still updating too early**  
   â†’ Console logs confirmed `update()` runs *before* state was `yes`.

6. **Discovered reattaching plugin element was necessary**  
   â†’ Realized field/state definitions are not hot-linked â€” must re-add plugin element for changes to take effect.

---

ðŸ’¡ Design Suggestions for Bubble:

- **Auto-bind newly exposed states** to existing plugin instances.
- **Allow field expressions to be static literals** (`yes`, `no`, `1`, etc.).
- **Expose a true plugin lifecycle hook** (like `afterPageLoad`) instead of relying on hacky `on page load` + group hydration.
- **Provide clear hydration status** directly on plugin instance (`instance.isHydrated()` or similar).
- **Warn if a plugin is using undefined or stale field/state bindings.**

---

These issues, while surmountable, make Bubble plugin development more brittle than it needs to be â€” especially for experienced developers expecting clear lifecycle guarantees.
