# Refactoring Guide

Code debt. Snarly, ad-hoc, organically fussed with, did i say temperamental? Man crawling across the desert, barely able to say "refactor, need refactor."

Aren't people saying, how perfect AI is at doing such a mundane, hair-pulling chore? Sure, but kinda know not to trust AI refactoring my baby. So, I asked it to compile these guidelines. Then, I asked it to use it on an easy, simple refactoring: [**Centralize timing of user clicks**](../analysis/refactor-clicks). The result? Nice, almost painless. Needed mild manual intervention, and go!

I plan to use this to do some harder refactoring, making a backup, first.

## General Principles

### 1. Centralization Over Distribution
**Move from scattered logic to single source of truth.**

**Pattern:**
- Before: Logic duplicated across multiple components
- After: One manager owns the responsibility
- Benefit: Consistency, easier debugging, single point of change

### 2. Declaration Over Management
**Components declare intent, manager handles execution.**

**Pattern:**
- Component sets properties: `needs_X = true`, `X_callback = fn`
- Manager reads properties and handles lifecycle automatically
- Component receives callbacks at appropriate times

### 3. State Persistence
**State lives on persistent objects, not ephemeral components.**

**Why:** Components can be destroyed/recreated. Shared state objects persist.

**Pattern:**
- Move state from component-local variables to shared state objects
- State survives component recreation
- Enables cross-component coordination

### 4. Enum-Based Configuration
**Single enum replaces multiple boolean flags.**

**Benefits:**
- Enforces mutual exclusivity or valid combinations
- Type-safe, self-documenting
- Easier to extend with new options

### 5. Automatic Lifecycle
**Manager handles all lifecycle automatically.**

**Events:**
- Start conditions → Manager detects and starts
- Stop conditions → Manager detects and stops
- Edge cases → Manager handles cleanup

### 6. Single Source of Truth
**One manager, one timer/cache/state per concern.**

**Benefits:**
- No conflicts between multiple instances
- Easier to reason about
- Better performance (shared resources)

## Refactoring Process

### Phase 1: Analysis
1. **Identify scattered logic** - Where is the same pattern repeated?
2. **Find the manager** - What should own this responsibility?
3. **Map state flow** - Where does state live? Where should it live?
4. **Identify lifecycle** - What are start/stop/cleanup conditions?

### Phase 2: Design
1. **Define the abstraction** - What properties/components are needed?
2. **Design the interface** - How do components declare intent?
3. **Plan state migration** - How to move from old to new?
4. **Design lifecycle** - When does manager start/stop/cleanup?

### Phase 3: Implementation
1. **Build manager infrastructure** - Core timing/state management
2. **Add target properties** - State and callbacks on shared objects
3. **Migrate components** - One by one, remove old logic
4. **Test edge cases** - Re-renders, hover-leave, rapid interactions

### Phase 4: Cleanup
1. **Remove deprecated patterns** - Old code, unused properties
2. **Update documentation** - Reflect new architecture
3. **Verify performance** - Ensure improvements realized

## Performance Optimization Principles

### 1. Batch Operations
**Group related work to minimize overhead.**

**Pattern:**
- Collect all changes first
- Apply in single batch
- Use spatial indexes for efficient queries

### 2. Lazy Evaluation
**Compute only when needed, cache when possible.**

**Pattern:**
- Don't precompute everything
- Compute on-demand
- Cache results until invalidated

### 3. Incremental Updates
**Update only what changed, not everything.**

**Pattern:**
- Track what changed
- Update only affected parts
- Skip unchanged work

### 4. Efficient Data Structures
**Choose structures optimized for access patterns.**

**Pattern:**
- Spatial queries → R-tree (RBush)
- Fast lookups → Maps/Dictionaries
- Sequential access → Arrays

### 5. Minimize Re-renders
**Reduce component recreation and style recomputation.**

**Pattern:**
- State on persistent objects (not components)
- Batch style updates
- Use reactive statements efficiently

## Simplification Principles

### 1. Remove Duplication
**Extract common patterns into shared logic.**

**Pattern:**
- Find repeated code blocks
- Extract to manager or utility
- Components call shared logic

### 2. Reduce Nesting
**Flatten conditional logic and state checks.**

**Pattern:**
- Early returns
- Guard clauses
- Extract complex conditions to named methods

### 3. Single Responsibility
**Each class/function does one thing well.**

**Pattern:**
- Manager: Owns timing/state
- Component: Declares needs, handles callbacks
- Target: Holds state and configuration

### 4. Clear Abstractions
**Names and structure reveal intent.**

**Pattern:**
- Enum values are self-documenting
- Method names describe what, not how
- Properties clearly indicate purpose

### 5. Eliminate Workarounds
**Replace hacks with proper solutions.**

**Pattern:**
- Identify workarounds (e.g., `s_mouse_forName` for state persistence)
- Design proper solution (state on target)
- Migrate away from workaround

## Migration Strategy

### Incremental Migration
**Migrate one component/feature at a time.**

**Benefits:**
- Lower risk
- Easier to test
- Can rollback individual changes

### Backward Compatibility
**Support both old and new patterns during transition.**

**Pattern:**
- Add new properties alongside old
- Manager supports both
- Remove old after migration complete

### Testing Strategy
**Test each migrated component thoroughly.**

**Focus:**
- Normal operation
- Edge cases (re-renders, rapid interactions)
- Regression (existing behavior preserved)

## Example: Mouse Timing Centralization

### Before: Distributed Timing
```
Component → Own Timer → Manual Start/Stop → Component State
```
- Each component manages its own timer lifecycle
- State lives in component (lost on re-render)
- Duplicated logic across components
- Manual hover-leave handling per component

### After: Centralized Timing
```
Component → Declares Intent → Central Manager → Automatic Lifecycle
```
- Single manager owns all timers
- State persists on shared target (survives re-render)
- Logic centralized in one place
- Automatic hover-leave cleanup

### Key Abstractions
- **Timing Types**: Autorepeat, long-click, double-click
- **State Transitions**: Down → Timer → Callback → Up
- **Configuration**: Enum-based (`T_Mouse_Detection`)
- **Lifecycle**: Automatic start/stop/cancel

### Migration Pattern
1. Remove component timer
2. Declare on target (`mouse_detection`, `*_callback`)
3. Remove manual lifecycle code
4. Test thoroughly

## Applying to Layout Algorithms

### Analysis Questions
1. **What is scattered?** - Layout logic in multiple places?
2. **What is the manager?** - Should there be a `Layout` manager?
3. **What is the state?** - Positions, sizes, constraints?
4. **What is the lifecycle?** - When to compute? When to update?

### Design Questions
1. **What do components declare?** - Size constraints? Position preferences?
2. **How does manager compute?** - Single pass? Incremental? Cached?
3. **What triggers updates?** - Size changes? Content changes? User actions?
4. **How to optimize?** - Spatial index? Dirty tracking? Batch updates?

### Simplification Opportunities
1. **Remove duplication** - Common layout patterns?
2. **Reduce complexity** - Nested calculations? Circular dependencies?
3. **Clear abstractions** - What are the core concepts?
4. **Eliminate workarounds** - Hacks for edge cases?

### Performance Opportunities
1. **Batch operations** - Compute all layouts together?
2. **Lazy evaluation** - Only compute visible/needed?
3. **Incremental updates** - Only update what changed?
4. **Efficient structures** - Spatial index for layout queries?
5. **Minimize re-renders** - Cache layout results?
