# Core

In my early work, once my first Svelte component was working, i used it as a template for others. Gradually, I found it difficult to coordinate them all. The app presented lots of inconsistent stuff, very unprofessional and confusing. I eventually gathered related bits of logic into small tightly related clumps and called them managers. I want to introduce them. The seven items here are responsible for most of the basic capabilities.
