# Core

For this project, I decided to use Svelte. Once my first component was working, i assumed it would make a good template for my next one. Unfortunately, by the time I built most of them, they became difficult to coordinate. Hovering acted oddly, cats were sleeping with dogs, very unreliable, unprofessional. The solution? I eventually gathered related bits of logic into small tightly related clumps and called them managers. Uniform and reliable behavior. These are they. The seven items here are responsible for the basic capabilities upon which everything relies.
